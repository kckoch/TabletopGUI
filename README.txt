This is a GUI that will accept an image of a 2D dungeon map (with the rooms being grey and the background black, though this can be edited), 
with no grids (though that can be edited) and figures out where the rooms and hallways are.

CURRENTLY KNOWN ISSUES
1) If there are two rooms that intersect along the first row or column, the reader will not be able to tell that they are two rooms and will 
clobber any rooms further down.
